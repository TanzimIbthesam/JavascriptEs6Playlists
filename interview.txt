//let,var and const 
//Let
//With let you cant redeclare a variable but you can change value of variable 
//Lets value declared inside the local scope cant be accessed outside of the local scope
//You can change the value of globalscope inside local scope with let
//Const
//You cant redefine or even change value of variable inside global or local scope 
//Short rule of thumb-Use const most of the times
